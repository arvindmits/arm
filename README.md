# azure-blueprints

**PREVIOUS ARM REPO**

The previous <https://github.com/richeney/arm> repo has been renamed to <https://github.com/richeney/arm-labs>.

**WORK IN PROGRESS**

Lab for creating Azure Blueprints for enterprise scaffolding of new subscriptions.  The repository contains examples ARM template modules, policies, custom roles and assignments, scripts etc.    

These are leveraged within the [Azure Citadel](https://aka.ms/citadel) lab to create the Blueprints both manually and programmatically.  The concepts and skills to create ARM modules is covered in the Citadel [ARM](https://aka.ms/citadel/arm).  This lab will include the creation of custom policies, policy initiatives, RBAC roles, etc.

The lab will also introduce subscription level ARM templates, service catalogs and managed applications, plus some ways in which partner recognition is achieved using [Partner Admin Link](https://aka.ms/partneradminlink) and [Customer Usage Attribution](https://aka.ms/customerusageattribution), which is also known as Tracked Templates.

Feel free to make use of any of the templates and policies within this repository for your own purposes. If there is functionality you would like to see in this repo then feel free to add a bug or feature request within GitHub.

Please note that directly accessing these templates and policies for production workloads is not recommended as they are designed for lab training purposes and may change without notice and without versioning, and there is no support. Use at your own risk!
